Lately, a lot of blockchain projects on Ethereum have been 'airdropping' tokens into the wallets of users. This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.

In many cases, the amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends on how much Ethereum you had at a specified block. Some airdrops distribute the same amount of tokens to everyone.

That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that everyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens. If you want to find out more information about the airdropped tokens you received in your wallet, you can look them up on the internet.
