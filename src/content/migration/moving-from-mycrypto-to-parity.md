Starting from Parity v1.10, Parity Ethereum client (the node) has been separated from the Parity User Interface (UI). The user interface previously accessible from the browser in versions <=1.9 is now released as a standalone app. Parity UI isnâ€™t actively maintained anymore.

### Place your Keystore file in the following locations:

*  `C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\Parity\Ethereum`

*  `/Users/you/Library/Application Support/io.parity.ethereum`

*  `/home/you/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum`

Then, open Parity and away you go. ðŸŽ‰

Command-line options:
```
--keys-path=[PATH]
  Specify the path for JSON key files to be found (default: $BASE/keys)
```
