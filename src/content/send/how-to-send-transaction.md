If you plan to move a large amount of Ether or tokens, you should first send a test transaction of a small amount to the destination wallet to ensure everything goes as planned.

1. Navigate to the [Send page](https://mycrypto.com/account).

2. Select how you would like to [access your wallet and unlock it](https://support.mycrypto.com/getting-started/accessing-your-new-eth-wallet.html).

3. Enter the address you would like to send to in the `To Address` field.

4. If you're sending ETH, move on the step 5. If you are sending a token, select which one you want to send from the dropdown on the right of the `Amount` field. If the token of your choice is not listed:

    a. In the sidebar, click [Add Custom Token](https://support.mycrypto.com/send/sending-and-adding-tokens.html).
    
    b. Enter the address, name, and decimals of the token. These are provided by the developers of the token and are also found on [ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/).
    
    c. Click "Save." You can now select that token in the dropdown next to the `Amount` field.

5. Enter the amount you would like to send.

    - Note: You can also click the little up arrows in the amount field if you would like the send the entire balance.

6. Click `Generate Transaction.` A couple more fields will appear. This is your browser generating the transaction.

7. Click the blue `Send Transaction` button below that. A pop-up will appear. Double-check that the amount, the type of coin, and the address are correct.

8. Click the `Yes, I am sure! Make transaction` button. 

The transaction will now be broadcasted to the network. At the bottom of the screen a green bar will show up where you can see the transaction hash and links to verifying the transaction has been sent via Etherscan or another block explorer. This is like a receipt of your transaction.


### Reminders

- Any transaction that you make will require gas which is paid in Ether. It is a transaction fee that is paid to the miners as an incentive to include your transactions in the blocks that they mine.

- For more information about gas, [please click here](https://support.mycrypto.com/gas/what-is-gas-ethereum.html).

- During busy network times, [please read here for more information](https://support.mycrypto.com/transactions/transactions-not-showing-or-pending.html) as to why your transaction is taking forever to get broadcasted onto the network.
