ShapeShift, the exchange MyCrypto uses for its [swap](https://mycrypto.com/swap) service, announced that users will be obligated to register for a membership, which requires basic personal information to be collected.


### Why?

The change by ShapeShift was decided by three key factors: user requests to have account-related features (e.g., transaction history, email notifications), an increasing interest in tokenization, and regulatory difficulties.

ShapeShift Membership consists of five levels; level 1 is available now, and levels 2-5 will be released at a later date. Level 1 allows for a transaction limit of $10,000, while higher levels (2-5) enable benefits such as a higher transaction limit, discounts on exchange rates, and volume-based rewards in FOX. In order to achieve these higher membership levels in the future, you will be required to hold a certain amount of [FOX tokens](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000591420-What-is-a-FOX-Token-) in your ShapeShift account.

You can create your ShapeShift Membership account on [portal.shapeshift.io](https://portal.shapeshift.io/).
