### Here is how you can turn your phone or tablet into a hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies using Parity Signer + MyCrypto

What is Parity Signer?

Parity Signer, available for iOS and Android, is an offline mobile app that securely generates and stores your private keys. Most mobile wallets connect to the internet, but Parity Signer gives you one extra layer of security: it never connects to the internet and can be used air-gapped.

Parity Signer has been the perfect companion with Parity Wallet, allowing users to create “watch-only” accounts on their networked computers while keeping their keys safer in the open-source mobile app.

But now, you can also use MyCrypto Beta to send transactions from your Parity Signer accounts without having to run your own Parity node.

### How to Get Started

1. Get the App
