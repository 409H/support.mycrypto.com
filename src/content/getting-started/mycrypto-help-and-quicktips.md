33. Install an ad blocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads.

34. Keystore File (UTC / JSON): This is encrypted by your password. It matches the format used by Mist so you can easily import it in the future.

36. MyCrypto supports viewing and sending all ERC-20 Tokens. You can add them yourself.

46. Phishers try to trick you with scary messages. Don't fall for them.

47. Private Key (unencrypted): This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. Keep it *offline*, like on *paper*!

48. Pro tip: When asking for help, be nice. Grouchy-pants get helped slower than a 1 GWEI TX on a token sale day.

49. See what gas price you should use at [http://ethgasstation.info](http://ethgasstation.info).

50. Send a test transaction first, and make sure it arrives at the intended destination before sending all your holdings.

51. Store backups of your Keystore file version and paper wallet in physically separate, offline environments.

52. The best passwords are strong and easy to remember. If you store your password with your Keystore file, it's pretty much useless.

53. The transaction (TX) fee = gas price * gas limit and is paid to miners for including your TX in a block. Higher gas price = faster TX, but is more expensive.

54. Turn on 2FA for *everything* today. Go do it. Right now.
