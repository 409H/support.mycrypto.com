**Send and receive Ethers**

It’s time for you to start sending and receiving Ethers.

  

We consider, in the following “How to”, that your device is already configured. If it’s not, please check our video on our website: “Configure your Safe-T mini”.

To send and receive Ethers, please connect to: _safe-t.io_.

  

The following webpage will be displayed:

Click on “GO TO MYCRYPTO” next to the Ether icon.

  

It will open a new webpage: [https://beta.mycrypto.com.](https://beta.mycrypto.com/)

Note that it opens [https://beta.mycrypto.com](https://beta.mycrypto.com/) instead of [www.mycrypto.com.](http://www.mycrypto.com/) Indeed, MyCrypto

team is merging our developments. This should take maximum two weeks.

  

Then follow these steps:

  

1.  Click  on  the  Safe-T  mini  icon

  

1.  Click  on  “Connect  to  Safe-T  mini”  and  enter  your  PIN  (numbers  will  be  displayed  on  your  Safe-T  mini  screen)

  

1.  Click  on  “Export”  and  enter  your  PIN  (numbers  will  be  displayed  on  your  Safe-T  mini  screen)

  

_By clicking on “Export”, you give MyCrypto access to your public keys. Those keys are public, so there are no issues sharing them._

  

1.  Select  the  address  on  which  you  want  to  send  /  receive  ethers  and  click  on  “Unlock”

  

_Different Ethereum addresses are displayed. All of these addresses are accessible via your Safe-T mini. Select the address you want to use for your transaction._

  

  **_MyCrypto is now connected to your Safe-T mini!_**

  

**RECEIVE ETHERS**

  

1) Click on “Request payment”

  

Your receiving address is now displayed in the “To Address” box; and also on the right side of the screen.

This is the address on which people will have to send ethers in order for you to receive them.

Gas are the fees to validate the ethers transaction. We recommend not changing the Gas limit displayed.

For security reasons, we also recommend you click on the “Display address on Safe-T mini” section. It will display your receiving address and your QR code on your Safe-T mini, so you can check they are the same as on your computer screen.

_Indeed, your computer screen could be hacked while what’s displayed on your Safe-T mini cannot._

  

**SEND ETHERS**

  

Click on “Send Ethers & Tokens”. The following page will open:

  

In the “To Address” box, enter the address of the person to who you’ll send ethers. In the “Amount” box, enter the amount of ethers you want to send.

You’ll need to adjust the “Transaction fee” bar. The more fee you put, the quicker your transaction will be validated. We recommend putting the “fee” bar in the middle.

  

When clicking on “Send”, you’ll have to validate the transaction on your computer and on your Safe- T mini.

_Make sure to check the information displayed on your Safe-T mini because that information can’t be hacked, while your computer and its screen can, and thus what your computer screen displays is not 100% safe!_

**Wallet info**

Click on “Wallet info”.

This displays the address and the QR code of the wallet you are using.

  

You can click once again on “Display address on Safe-T mini” to check that the information is the same as displayed on your Safe-T mini.

**Recent transaction**

  

By clicking on “Recent transaction”, history of your transactions is displayed.

**_Note than MyCrypto will also be used to send and receivie Ethers Classic and ERC20 tokens._**
