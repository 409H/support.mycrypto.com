All you need is the 24 seed words that you wrote down when you first initially setup the TREZOR. You can use the words on MyCrypto to recover your ETH/ETC/Tokens.

If you used any passphrases on the TREZOR and used any ETH/ETC/Tokens with a passphrase protected wallet, then you will also need the relevant passphrase.

**Do not store these recovery words on your computer, as it will be just as unsafe as using a normal private key. Always write it down physically using a pen, on a piece of paper only you have access to. Also do not take a photo of your piece of paper.**
